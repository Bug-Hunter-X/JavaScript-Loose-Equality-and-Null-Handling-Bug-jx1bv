This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to loose equality (==) and null value handling.  The `bug.js` file contains code with the error, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  The bug arises from implicit type coercion when using loose equality, potentially leading to unexpected results.  The solution emphasizes explicit null checks for robustness.
